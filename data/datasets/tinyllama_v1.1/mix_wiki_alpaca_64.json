First is that I have used the standard MySQL error handling, which will likely catch the error if it is thrown.\nSecond, the mysqli_stmt is a bit more secure against SQL Injections.  This method uses the prepared statement, which is a bit more secure.  That said, this will not prevent SQL Injections, as it does not apply any checks on the values that are being sent to the server.\n\nA: I would do this in an array and then use the array index as a variable in the query to send multiple variables to the database.\n$sql= \"INSERT INTO members\n        (first_name, last_name, email, password, username)\n        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n\n    $stmt = mysql_prepare($sql, $vals);\n\n    $first_name = $_POST['first_name'];\n    $last_name = $_POST['last_name'];\n    $email   = $_POST['email'];\n    $password = $_POST['password'];\n    $username = $_POST['username'];\n\n    $stmt->bind_param('ssssss', $first_name, $last_name, $email, $password, $username);\n\n    if(mysql_stmt_execute($stmt)){\n        echo \"success\";\n    }\n\n"]]

[["Compare two different types of primary memory.\n", "Several people, including a 10-year-old, were killed in the crash on Interstate 5, which remained open while crews worked to clear the scene.\nAt least 70 vehicles were involved, according to authorities.\nThe crash happened about 1:30 p.m. in the northbound lanes of the highway near Dodge Road, said Officer David Estrada, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol.\nThe collision was reported at 1:40 p.m., Estrada said. Five of the six lanes were closed, he said.\nThe cause of the crash was unknown, Estrada said.\nIt was not immediately clear what caused the car to jump the curb.\nWitnesses told police that the car sped toward the left curb, Estrada said.\nEleven people were taken to area hospitals, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department.\nMoments after the crash, a crowd of about 50 people gathered near the scene, many of them crying.\n\"They were screaming, like, 'Oh my God, my daughter,\" said one man, who declined to give his name. \"They just kept screaming.\"\nAnother man, Dale McInnis, said he was on his way to work when he got a call about the crash.\n\"I saw the whole scene, and I just started crying,\" he said.\nA witness said she saw a car speeding toward the curb, and then someone jumped off the curb.\n\"I saw a white car speeding toward the curb,\" said Sara Dahir, 33, who was at the scene. \"I saw the car just hit the curb. I saw the car just explode.\"\nThe driver's side of the car was on fire, she said.\nOther witnesses said they saw a man jump from the vehicle, but they could not tell what happened to his body.\n\"I saw the car just fly off,\" said one witness, who did not want to give her name. \"I didn't see anything but the car just flew off.\"\nThe car sped toward the left curb, Estrada said.\n\"The driver's side was on fire, and the driver's side was completely destroyed,\" he said.\nA witness said she was in her car when she heard an explosion and saw a car fly off the road, and then a fireball.\n\"My daughter was screaming for me,\" the woman, who declined to give her name, said. \"When I got to her, she was crying. I saw the car speeding toward the curb, and the driver jumped out and was on fire.\"\nThe vehicle hit the curb, Estrada said.\n\"The impact actually caused the vehicle to jump the curb,\" he said.\nThe driver's side of the car hit the curb, Estrada said.\n\"It's still on fire,\" one witness said.\nAnother witness said he saw a driver jump from the vehicle, but he could not say what happened to his body.\n\"I looked up, and there were just flames shooting out of the car,\" the witness, who declined to give his name, said.\nAnother witness said he saw a driver jump from the vehicle, but he could not tell what happened to his body.\n\"I saw the car just fly off,\" said one witness, who declined to give his name. \"I saw the car just flew off.\"\nAt least five people were taken to area hospitals, Estrada said.\nThe crash was being investigated jointly by the CHP and the Los Angeles County Fire Department.\nEstrada said the driver of the car, whose identity was not released, was still at the scene.\nHe declined to identify the victim or the driver of the car, because authorities were still investigating.\n\"We don't know what caused it,\" he said. \"We're still trying to find out what happened.\"\nThe crash was the latest in a string of deadly collisions involving vehicles on California's freeways. Last month, a driver was killed in a crash on the 101 freeway when his vehicle crossed into the other lane and struck a vehicle, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nThe Times reported that the driver of the vehicle that was struck by the car may have not have been paying attention.\nAnother driver killed in the crash was a 2-year-old child, the Times reported. He was sitting in a booster seat when he was killed, the newspaper reported.\nThe crash happened about 1:30 p.m."]]

In order to transport people and goods across the country in a timely and cost-effective manner, various technologies have been developed. The use of technology is critical to the modern transportation industry. In this article, we will discuss some of the different technology that has been developed and how it has had an impact on the transportation industry.\nWi-Fi routers have become increasingly popular in recent years as homeowners have become more and more aware of the benefits of wireless internet connections. While many people are familiar with the general functionality of a router, there are a number of different technologies that have been developed that allow routers to do a variety of different things.\nOne of the most basic functions of a router is to provide access to the internet. Routers are typically located close to the network interface card and are able to communicate with the internet using a wireless connection. The most basic wireless technology is 802.11b, which is commonly used in home networks.\nOther types of wireless technologies include 802.11a, which is the standard for wireless in most modern homes. 802.11a provides data rates up to 54 Mbps, which is more than sufficient for most modern homes. 802.11n is another popular wireless technology that provides data rates up to 600 Mbps.\n802.11ad is another popular wireless technology that provides data rates up to 2160 Mbps. 802.11ac is another popular wireless technology that provides data rates up to 400 Mbps. These technologies have been developed to provide a high-speed connection to the internet, which is a benefit for homeowners who want to get the most out of their wireless internet connections.\nWi-Fi routers have also been developed that provide data rates up to 10 Gbps. This technology was designed for applications that require a large data rate, such as high-speed video streaming.\nDue to the increasing popularity of wireless technologies, routers are becoming more and more common in homes. In addition to providing access to the internet, a router can also be used to provide wireless access to other devices such as smartphones and tablets. This technology has become increasingly popular because it allows users to connect to the internet without having to worry about cables or wires.\nAnother technology that has become increasingly popular in recent years is the use of mesh networking. Mesh networking is a network topology that allows multiple devices to connect to each other using a single network connection. This technology allows for a more efficient use of bandwidth and is often used to provide a high-speed connection to the internet.\nMesh networking has become increasingly popular because it allows users to connect to the internet without having to worry about cables or wires. Mesh networking also allows for a more efficient use of bandwidth, which is often one of the most important factors in determining the speed of a network connection.\nIn order to connect to the internet, a router is typically required. However, wireless routers are not the only type of router that is available. Wired routers are also becoming increasingly popular as they offer more reliability and security.\nWi-Fi routers have become increasingly popular as they offer a more reliable and secure connection to the internet.
